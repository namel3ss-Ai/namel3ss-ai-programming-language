# Roadmap (stub)

- **0.9.x**: Finalize stability guardrails (versioning, deprecations, golden suite), tighten provider abstractions.
- **1.0.0**: Grammar and IR freeze; steady APIs for providers and plugins; strengthened migration tooling.
- **1.x**: Expanded plugin ecosystem, richer observability, and hardened distributed execution paths.
- **2.x** (forward-looking): Advanced orchestration, policy enforcement, and deeper enterprise security features.

Roadmap items are directional and may evolve; breaking changes will follow the documented versioning and deprecation policy.
